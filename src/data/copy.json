For someone in his 60s, these are potential red flags – because he could be missing something critical to human survival: <span>social bonds</span>.\r\n\r\n\r\nMany animals – especially  humans – need social bonds. Humans evolved to <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4684-6694-2_3\">survive in groups</a>, whether that's gathering food or fighting off predators.
